<h3>Managment system for patient information.</h3>

<p> Slim PHP + JavasScript/AJAX + MySQL/<p>
<p>The database constain a large number of rows</p>
<p>regular table pagination solutions are not suitable, as the whole data must be sent at once, and javascipt is used to paginate the results</p>
<p>Here we implement an AJAX solution in which data for each table page is requested asynchronously from a REST API </p>
